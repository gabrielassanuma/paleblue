        <h3>Non Fungible Raffles</h3>
        <p class="t">We use Non Fungible Tokens minted on the blockchain to function as Raffle tickets for physical and digital art, collectibles, and other rare objects. <br>
        NFTs can represent real-world items like artwork and real estate. <br>
        "Tokenizing" these real-world tangible assets makes buying, selling, and trading them more efficient while reducing the probability of fraud. </p>

        <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
        <p class="t">1. To participate in the raffle, pick the corresponding NFT Raffle Ticket. <br> 2. After all tickets are sold, a Random Number Generator will determine the winning NFT Raffle Ticket by unique PaleBlue Token. <br> 3. The Wallet Address holding the winning NFT Raffle Ticket will recieve a unique 'Winners NFT' which will have unlockable content allowing the winner to claim the piece.</p>

        <h3>Why NFTs Are Important</h3>
        <p class="t">Non-fungible tokens are an evolution of the relatively simple concept of cryptocurrencies. Modern finance systems consist of sophisticated trading and loan systems for different asset types, ranging from real estate to lending contracts to artwork. By enabling digital representations of physical assets, NFTs are a step forward in the reinvention of this infrastructure.</p>
